Padlock is a secure browser-based file transfer system.

This code was written in 2004, before web frameworks came into prominence.  It includes (rough) session management, authentication, and a pseudo-hierarchical user account system.

It was written at the Slone Epidemiology center at Boston University (http://www.bu.edu/slone) to allow hospital end-users to securely send data to researchers.

I believe it was finally deprecated in 2009 or 2010, after 5-6 years of use.
